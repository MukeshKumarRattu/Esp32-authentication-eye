# Esp32 authentication eye
 It's developed officially by Espresif as an attempt to quickly get started to create image recognition or Fingerprint authentication-related application.

I develops a sample application that makes the most use of the board, namely: Esp32 Authentication Eye. To me, it's an awesome project that shows how to do Fingerprint recognition and face recognition, all done at the edge or on the board itself, not in the cloud.

While Esp32 Authentication Eye is great for making use of the board and embracing edge intelligence, I want to do something else. As a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) of Microsoft Azure (my profile), I want to make use of Azure services, specifically Azure Custom Vision, to be used as cloud-based image recognition engine. It is exactly the reason I created this repo.
